      <h2 id="termsofuse">Terms and Conditions</h2>

      <p>
        By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure
        therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app,
        any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code
        of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions.
        The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights
        related to it, still belong to DSOM LLC.
      </p>

      <p>
        DSOM LLC is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible.
        For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time
        and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you
        exactly what you’re paying for.
      </p>

      <p>
        The SimpleCam: On-camera assistant app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us,
        in order to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure.
        We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software
        restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone
        vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
        that the SimpleCam: On-camera assistant app won’t work properly or at all.
      </p>

      <ul class="list-content">
        The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.

        You should be aware that there are certain things that DSOM LLC will not take responsibility for.
        Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection.
        The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but DSOM LLC cannot take
        responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you
        don’t have any of your data allowance left.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement
        with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider
        for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges.
        In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you
        use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you
        are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you
        have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
      </p>

      <p>
        Along the same lines, DSOM LLC cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need
        to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the
        Service, DSOM LLC cannot accept responsibility.

        liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality
        of the app.

        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on iOS – the requirements for
        system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and
